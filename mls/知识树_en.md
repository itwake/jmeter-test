# 🌲 Machine Learning Knowledge Tree

## 🧠 Machine Learning (ML)

Machine learning is a subfield of AI that allows computers to learn from data. Major branches include:

---

## 1. Supervised Learning
### 📌 Classification
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree / Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Networks (MLP)

### 📌 Regression
- Linear Regression
- Ridge / Lasso Regression
- Gradient Boosting Trees (XGBoost, LightGBM)

**📍 Applications:** House price prediction, disease diagnosis, credit scoring

---

## 2. Unsupervised Learning
### 📌 Clustering
- K-Means
- DBSCAN
- Hierarchical Clustering

### 📌 Dimensionality Reduction
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- t-SNE / UMAP

**📍 Applications:** Customer segmentation, anomaly detection, data visualization

---

## 3. Reinforcement Learning
- Q-Learning
- Deep Reinforcement Learning (DQN, PPO, A3C)

**📍 Applications:** Game AI (e.g. AlphaGo), autonomous driving, robotics

---

## 4. Deep Learning
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) → Image processing
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN, LSTM, GRU) → Sequence modeling
- Transformer architecture → Basis for LLMs
- GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) → Image/video generation

**📍 Applications:** Image recognition, speech recognition, text generation, language understanding

---

## 5. Generative Learning
- AutoEncoder
- Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)
- GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)
- Large Language Models (LLMs: GPT, BERT, T5, etc.)

**📍 Applications:** Image generation, text generation, music, video creation

---

## 6. Semi / Self-Supervised Learning
- Pseudo-labeling
- Contrastive learning (SimCLR, BYOL)

**📍 Applications:** Pretraining for large models (especially LLMs and vision models)
